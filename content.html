	    					<h2>Prioritizing Safety over Poverty</h2>
							<br>
							<p>								
                               In this impeccable world that we are living in, poverty has been violently shaking the stability of the country's administration, especially in the Philippines. This issue is mainly caused by heightening levels of population growth.
							   Hunger and malnutrition statistic levels peaks due to a lack of money and resources among poverty-stricken people as resources lessen due to high population growth. Also, this results in impoverished people who spend too much money,
							   not having the ability to support the increasing number of members of their families, and the inability to afford housing due to lack of employment and education. Furthermore, GDP per capita is decreasing as the number of poverty-stricken
							   people increases. Moreover, overpopulation is not the only issue that impacted poverty. Economic decline and corruptions are also factors that maintain the burning rage of poverty.
                               We need a solution to diminish all the factors of poverty in just a blink of the eye. We need as well as a solution that does not require an enormous amount of funds to implement. All of these together will formulate a solution that will
							   benefit everyone as they may profit from it. That solution is death. Don't they want an honorable demise?  At least these poverty-stricken people will be the reason why the country isn't crumbling. 
							</p>
							<p>
                               Deaths of poverty-stricken people, ending the lives of worthless people, are necessary to diminish poverty. But how will we implement this? The Philippine government should create a televised battle that consists of 600 tributes from each
							   region. Not to mention that the prioritized tributes ages between 13 and 18 years old from each region. These 10,200 tributes are required to fight for their lives to survive the massacre. Besides, there would be 12 tournaments yearly as
							   each battle separated into 12 episodes. Not to mention that the government should pay Php 1000 to the family in exchange for sacrificing the useless child. In exchange for enjoyment, the viewers should pay Php 500 to view each segment.
							   Who would not want to abandon their worthless child to gain money? Likewise, who would resist watching an exciting purge of children killing each other for their survival and the enjoyment of the viewers? Everyone will agree with this convenient solution.
							</p>
							<p> 
                               The main benefit of this proposal is that over-population, the substantial factor of poverty, can be solved a million times faster. Using statistics, 6,573,356 people are living in extreme poverty in 2020, which is approximately 6% of the population of the
							   Philippines. Using the televised massacre concept, 10,199 will die every month. Notably, this equivalents to 122,388 dying yearly just because of the massacre alone. The people who die yearly is approximately 1.8% of all the people living in extreme poverty.
							   If we also include the death rate of the Philippines and continues in the following 12 years, there would be 6,101,294 number of deaths, which is 93% of the population of the poverty-stricken. The remaining 7% would likely have the same faith as their ancestors,
							   or they will work hard to flourish. 
							</p>
							<p> 
                               The second benefit of this solution is that corruption will decrease and will result in the improvement of the government’s efficiency. For the enhancement of the government, the Officials will use the remaining 75% of the earnings of the televised massacre.
							   Also, they may use this for their adequate corruption. The money acquired may also help the Philippines pay their negligible debt to the Bureau of Treasury.  
							</p>
							<p>
                               The third benefit of this solution is that the family and the middle class or the elites would benefit at the same time. The family of the winning tribute would receive a quarter of the earned money from the tournament. As a result, they would overcome their
							   impoverished status and reach the middle class using the consolation price the tribute received. While for the middle class and elites, they would enjoy the show because they are going to pay just a chump change of Php 500. 
							</p>
							<p>
                               The last benefit of this solution is that teenage pregnancy among poverty-stricken people will decline. Due to the prioritized tributes ranges from 13 to 18 years old, the lower the possibility of early sexual debut as they lack access to family planning services.
							   Moreover, the poverty-stricken parents cannot even educate their children on comprehensive sex information because of their lack of education that resulted in them being dumb. 
							</p>
							<p>
                               Our Filipino ancestors spent decades to find the worst solutions for the Philippines to overcome poverty. They have come up with parents adopting children rather than making their own, restricting child marriage by raising the legal age of marriage, improving health
							   care to reduce infant and child mortality, funding family planning programs, and many more. Officials of the Philippines even adhered to the National Anti-Poverty Commission for two decades and counting. With these implemented, have the population started to maintain
							   a constant rate? Of course not. The inhabitants are still on the rise, and this needs to be solved immediately using the best solution, death.
